                        Though often overshadowed (especially for tourists) by its much larger
                        and more famous neighbor Amsterdam about ten miles east, Haarlem’s history
                        actually goes back further. And with about 150,000 people, it’s the
                        capital of the Noord-Holland region.
                    </p>

                        Named by the Huffington Post, as one of the “10 Secret European Spots
                        You’ll Want To Visit Stat” you should definitely include Haarlem on your

                    <p>
                            There are few sights more quintessentially Dutch than that of
                            a windmill looming over a river, and the Molen (windmill) de Adriaan
                            is one of the finest examples in the region. The imposing wooden tower
                            has been a definitive feature on Haarlem’s skyline since the 18th
                            century, although the existing windmill is actually a reconstruction
                            (the original sadly burnt down in 1932). The mill is open for guided
                            tours that include spectacular views across Haarlem’s rooftops from
                            its riverside platform.

                    <p>
                        The neighborhood Haarlem Centrum is completely enclosed by canals:
                        The new moat, the Spaarne, the Kampersingel, the Leidsevaart and
                        part of the Kinderhuis Singel. In the beautiful city center of Haarlem
                        there are many beautiful streets that are enriched by stately monuments.
                        The history Haarlem has to offer is also found everywhere. Haarlem has
                        cosy shopping streets and a wide variety of catering options. In the summer
                        it is wonderful to sit along the Spaarne and in the city parks like the wood.

                        With so many picturesque tourist sights, excellent museums, 
                        boutique shopping, good hotels, sandy beaches and a wide range of
                        restaurants, Haarlem is a great holiday destination or a wonderful
                        city-break for a weekend away. It makes a great alternative for visitors
                        wishing to discover an authentic Dutch city – and avoid the more tourist-trodden
                        paths of Europe.

                        Get to the heart of things at the Grote Markt
                        At the historic heart of Haarlem, this vast square is located
                        underneath the imposing Grote Kerk, and is the image of the city
                        that many people will recognise. Hosting regular festivals, concerts
                        and markets, the Grote Markt is the hub of daily life in Haarlem and
                        just happens to be one of the prettiest city squares in the country.
                        Go there on a Saturday when the Netherlands’ finest street market rolls
                        out its wares.

                    <h3>What is Taekwondo?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Taekwondo (also known as Tae Kwon Do) is the art of self defense
                        that originated in Korea. It is recognized as one of the oldest
                        forms of martial arts in the world, reaching back over 2,000 years.
                        The name was selected for its appropriate description of the art: Tae
                        (foot), Kwon (hand), Do (art).

                    <h3>History of Taekwondo</h3>

                    <p>
                        One of the earliest clues of Taekwondo’s existence is a mural painted
                        on the wall of a tomb that was built in the Korean kingdom of Koguryo,
                        between 37 BC and 66 AD. The drawing shows two unarmed figures facing each
                        other in a Taekwondo style stance. Additional drawings in the tomb show figures
                        performing blocks and wearing uniforms similar to those used in modern day
                        Taekwondo training.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The advancement of Taekwondo and its techniques developed as the country of
                        Korea developed. There are examples and history of Taekwondo training in
                        virtually all the records of the different kingdoms that existed within the
                        country throughout the centuries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        
                        The highest form of the ancient art was achieved in the kingdom of Silla.
                        This tiny kingdom constantly faced attacks and opposition from larger and stronger
                        areas. As a result the ruler of the kingdom, King Jin Heung, established an
                        elite group of warriors called the “Hwarang” or “Flower of Youth”.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The Hwarang consisted of the sons of nobles within the kingdom. They were
                        carefully selected and formally trained in all aspects of military skills
                        including unarmed combat, which at the time was known as Tae Kyon. It is
                        significant that the Hwarang were taught not only the importance of developing
                        their bodies, but their minds and spirits as well. In addition to fighting
                        techniques, the young warriors were instructed in history, poetry, and philosophy.
                        The entire body of study was known as Hwarang Do. The Hwarang gained skills
                        not only for battle, but for daily life. This relates directly to modern
                        Taekwondo training, which provides self defense skills as well as improved
                        character, self-discipline, and confidence that can be applied to any task.

                    <p>
                        For thousands of years, martial art has been used
                        for so much more than just self-defense. It helps children
                        with discipline and focus. They are more concentrated at school,
                        gain self-confidence and have respect for their parents and others.
                        Every lesson the children train their fitness in a fun way. Taekwondo
                        keeps them healthy and strong, develops their balance, coordination
                        and strength. Taekwondo is offered by us for every level and every
                        age (from 7 years).

                        influences from other styles. Continuous work is being done to push
                        boundaries through self-defense, sparring and traditional training.

                <header><h3>What is Taekwondo?</h3></header>
                <p>Taekwondo (also known as Tae Kwon Do) is the art of self defense
                    that originated in Korea. It is recognized as one of the oldest
                    forms of martial arts in the world, reaching back over 2,000 years.
                    The name was selected for its appropriate description of the art: Tae
                    (foot), Kwon (hand), Do (art).</p>
            </section>
            <article class="section img-bg">

                <header><h3 class="textheader">History of Taekwondo</h3></header>
                <p>One of the earliest clues of Taekwondo’s existence is a mural painted
                    on the wall of a tomb that was built in the Korean kingdom of Koguryo,
                    between 37 BC and 66 AD. The drawing shows two unarmed figures facing each
                    other in a Taekwondo style stance. Additional drawings in the tomb show figures
                    performing blocks and wearing uniforms similar to those used in modern day
                    Taekwondo training.

                        The advancement of Taekwondo and its techniques developed as the country of
                        Korea developed. There are examples and history of Taekwondo training in
                        virtually all the records of the different kingdoms that existed within the
                        country throughout the centuries.
                        
                        The highest form of the ancient art was achieved in the kingdom of Silla.
                        This tiny kingdom constantly faced attacks and opposition from larger and stronger
                        areas. As a result the ruler of the kingdom, King Jin Heung, established an
                        elite group of warriors called the “Hwarang” or “Flower of Youth”.
                        
                        The Hwarang consisted of the sons of nobles within the kingdom. They were
                        carefully selected and formally trained in all aspects of military skills
                        including unarmed combat, which at the time was known as Tae Kyon. It is
                        significant that the Hwarang were taught not only the importance of developing
                        their bodies, but their minds and spirits as well. In addition to fighting
                        techniques, the young warriors were instructed in history, poetry, and philosophy.
                        The entire body of study was known as Hwarang Do. The Hwarang gained skills
                        not only for battle, but for daily life. This relates directly to modern
                        Taekwondo training, which provides self defense skills as well as improved
                        character, self-discipline, and confidence that can be applied to any task.

                    Following the Silla dynasty came the Koryo dynasty (935 AD – 1352 AD) from
                    which Korea takes its name. Martial arts practice, known as Subak Do, became
                    popular as an organized sport with detailed rules. The royal family sponsored
                    competitions and demonstrations, and martial arts became deeply rooted in Korean
                    culture.
